# {{PROBLEM}} Multi-Class Planned Design Recipe

## 1. Describe the Problem

As a user
So that I can record my experiences
I want to keep a regular diary

As a user
So that I can reflect on my experiences
I want to read my past diary entries

As a user
So that I can reflect on my experiences in my busy day
I want to select diary entries to read based on how much time I have and my reading speed

As a user
So that I can keep track of my tasks
I want to keep a todo list along with my diary

As a user
So that I can keep track of my contacts
I want to see a list of all of the mobile phone numbers in all my diary entries

## 2. Design the Class System

_Consider diagramming out the classes and their relationships. Take care to
focus on the details you see as important, not everything. The diagram below
uses asciiflow.com but you could also use excalidraw.com, draw.io, or miro.com_

```


  ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ Diary():                             │
  │  -public property: diary_entry       │
  │  -add_entries()                      │
  │  -diary_entries()                    │
  │  -diary_entries_to_read()            │
  │  -task_tracker()                     │
  │  -list_of_contacts()                 │
  │                                      │
  └──────────────────┬───────────────────┘
                     │diary contains a list of diary entries
                     │
  ┌──────────────────▼───────────────────┐
  │ Diary_entries():                     │
  │                                      │
  │  -count_word()                       │
  │                                      │
  │                                      │
  │                                      │
  │                                      │
  │                                      │
  │                                      │
  └──────────────────────────────────────┘




```

_Also design the interface of each class in more detail._

```python
class Diary():

    def __init__():
        entries_list = []

    def add_entries():
        Parameters:
            entry: string
        Side-effects:
            adding diary entries to a list of diary entries

    def list_of_diary_entries():
        Parameters:
            None
        Returns:
            list of diary entries

    def diary_entries_to_read():
        Parameters:
            minutes, wpm: two integers
        Returns:
            the best match of diary entries

    def task_tracker():
        Parameters:
            entry: string
        Returns:
            list which contains #TODO

    def list_of_contacts():
        Parameters:
            entry: string
        Returns:
            list of all the mobile phone numbers





class MusicLibrary:
    # User-facing properties:
    #   tracks: list of instances of Track

    def __init__(self):
        pass # No code here yet

    def add(self, track):
        # Parameters:
        #   track: an instance of Track
        # Side-effects:
        #   Adds the track to the tracks property of the self object
        pass # No code here yet

    def search_by_title(self, keyword):
        # Parameters:
        #   keyword: string
        # Returns:
        #   A list of the Track objects that have titles that include the keyword
        pass # No code here yet


class Track:
    # User-facing properties:
    #   title: string
    #   artist: string

    def __init__(self, title, artist):
        # Parameters:
        #   title: string
        #   artist: string
        # Side-effects:
        #   Sets the title and artist properties
        pass # No code here yet

    def format(self):
        # Returns:
        #   A string of the form "TITLE by ARTIST"
        pass # No code here yet

```

## 3. Create Examples as Integration Tests

_Create examples of the classes being used together in different situations and
combinations that reflect the ways in which the system will be used._

```python
# EXAMPLE

"""
Given a library
When we add two tracks
We see those tracks reflected in the tracks list
"""
library = MusicLibrary()
track_1 = Track("Carte Blanche", "Veracocha")
track_2 = Track("Synaesthesia", "The Thrillseekers")
library.add(track_1)
library.add(track_2)
library.tracks # => [track_1, track_2]
```

## 4. Create Examples as Unit Tests

_Create examples, where appropriate, of the behaviour of each relevant class at
a more granular level of detail._

```python
# EXAMPLE

"""
Given a track with a title and an artist
We see the title reflected in the title property
"""
track = Track("Carte Blanche", "Veracocha")
track.title # => "Carte Blanche"
```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 5. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green,
refactor to implement the behaviour._
